Hey everyone,
<br /> 
Here is a repository for our project. It contains two folders: Heatmaps and App. <br /> 
  -Heatmaps folder contains files showing the distribution of wines based on various criteria on a map. <br /> 
  -App folder contains all the files for the app to work. The application suggests 5 best wines for your preferences. <br /> 
<br /> 
  In order to try it, download the files and run it on your computer. Have fun :)
